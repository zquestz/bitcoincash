# BitcoinCash.org

This is the repository for [bitcoincash.org](https://bitcoincash.org). As the Bitcoin Cash community expands, we hope that many will participate and improve this project over time.

## Build & Run the Docker Image

In order to build and run the site you need ruby and docker. Then run:

1. `gem install bundler`
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec rake docker:build`
4. `docker run -p 8888:80 bitcoincash:latest`

Now the site is running at http://localhost:8888.

To refresh the site after making changes:

```
# ctrl-c the running docker process.
bundle exec rake docker:build && docker run -p 8888:80 bitcoincash:latest
```

The site is running at http://localhost:8888 with your changes.

## Contributions

If you want to submit updates to the website make sure you are editing the templates in the `views` directory. These are used to generate all translated html files via `rake translations:build`.

Note: Image files for projects will not load if against a transparent background or will extend out of card if too oddly sized. Best to use approximately 400x250 plain white card, with logo in the center.

## Adding Translations

### Collaborative Translations via CrowdIn

We now use [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/bitcoin-cash) for collaborative translation management! This platform makes it easier for the community to contribute translations and ensures better coordination between translators.

**To contribute translations:**

1. Visit our [Bitcoin Cash CrowdIn project](https://crowdin.com/project/bitcoin-cash)
2. Create a free CrowdIn account if you don't have one
3. Select your language and start translating
4. Your contributions will be reviewed by language coordinators and integrated into the project

### Manual Translation Process

Alternatively, you can still contribute translations manually by using `translations/en.yml` as a template and create a new file for your locale. Then translate all the content inside of the yaml file and send us a pull request.

**Benefits of using CrowdIn:**

- Real-time collaboration with other translators
- Translation memory and consistency checks
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Professional translation management tools
- Community-driven translation reviews

## Listing Policy for Exchanges, Wallets, and Projects

Although many exchanges, wallets, and other projects would like to be listed on our website, BitcoinCash.org is not meant
to be an exhaustive directory. There is limited space and quite simply, we only want to showcase the best of the best.

Only the top several exchanges by trading volume in each country will be considered.

For wallets, we only want to list those that have the highest trust and best reputation within the community. Relevant factors include the brand, the age of the wallet, as well as the track record of the company, developers, and/or other individuals involved.

We apologize in advance if we're unable to provide a listing for you on BitcoinCash.org. We acknowledge the criteria for wallet listings are somewhat subjective. Please understand our decisions are not personal, but rather based on a conservative approach and our responsbility to safeguard the community against questionable projects. Lastly, no listing should be interpreted as our explicit endorsement.
