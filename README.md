# bitcoincash

This is the repository for [bitcoincash.org](https://bitcoincash.org). As the Bitcoin Cash community expands, we hope that many will participate and improve this project over time.

Build & Run the Docker Image
----------------------------

In order to build and run the site you need ruby and docker. Then run:

1. `gem install bundler`
2. `bundle install`
3. `rake docker:build`
4. `docker run -d -p 8888:80 zquestz/bitcoincash`
# Site running at localhost:8888, using the immutable remote docker container

To refresh the site after making changes:
```
docker ps # Grab container name
docker stop [name]
# Make changes e.g. to index.html.erb
rake docker:build
docker run -d -p 8888:80 bitcoincash:latest
# Site running at localhost:8888, with latest local changes
```

Contributions
-------------

If you want to submit updates to the website make sure you are editing `index.html.erb`. This is the template used to generate all translated html files via `rake translations:build`.

Note: Image files for projects will not load if against a transparent background or will extend out of card if too oddly sized.  Best to use approximately 400x250 plain white card, with logo in the center.

Adding Translations
-------------------

To add translations to the project, use `translations/en.yml` as a template and create a new file for your locale. Then translate all the content inside of the yaml file and send us a pull request.

Listing Policy for Exchanges, Wallets, and Projects
---------------------------------------------------

Although many exchanges, wallets, and other projects would like to be listed on our website, BitcoinCash.org is not meant
to be an exhaustive directory.  There is limited space and quite simply, we only want to showcase the best of the best.

Only the top several exchanges by trading volume in each country will be considered.  

For wallets, we only want to list those that have the highest trust and best reputation within the community.  Relevant factors include the brand, the age of the wallet, as well as the track record of the company, developers, and/or other individuals involved.

We apologize in advance if we're unable to provide a listing for you on BitcoinCash.org.  We acknowledge the criteria for wallet listings are somewhat subjective. Please understand our decisions are not personal, but rather based on a conservative approach and our responsbility to safeguard the community against questionable projects.  Lastly, no listing should be interpreted as our explicit endorsement.
